# interface-ai
InterfaceAI is a Chrome extension that turns natural language into action, ask it to “book a flight to New York” or “set up an AWS instance,” and it handles the steps for you. Using intent recognition, vision-based execution, and contextual awareness, it explores webpages and builds digital profiles to make technology work for you.
