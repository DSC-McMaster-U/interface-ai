<h1 align="center">🤖 InterfaceAI</h1>

## 🚀 Project Overview

**InterfaceAI** is a Chrome extension that turns natural language into action.  
Ask it to “set up an AWS instance,” “book a flight,” or “open my calculus lecture,” and it will understand your intent, navigate webpages, and execute tasks directly on your screen.  

By combining intent recognition, vision-based action execution, and contextual awareness, InterfaceAI goes beyond existing tools with autonomous webpage exploration and personalized digital profiles—building the next generation of AI agents that make technology work for you.
